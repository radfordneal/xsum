Significant changes in version of 2021-05-17 (tagged as stable-version-2):

  Added xsum_small_add_accumulator and xsum_large_add_accumulator
  procedures, for adding one superaccumulator to another.

  Added xsum_small_negate and xsum_large_negate for negating the
  value in a superaccumulator.

  Added procedures xsum_large_to_small_accumulator and 
  xsum_small_to_large_accumulator, for converting between
  superaccumulator types.

  Added an xsum_large_add1 procedure for completeness.   

  Wrote documentation on the API in api-doc.

  Changed default xsum_length type to ptrdiff_t (from int), so array
  lengths on 64-bit systems will be accomodated, while still (hopefully)
  being 32 bits in size on 32-bit systems.

  Changed build process so pbinary.c is needed only if asked for
  (used only for debug output).

  Various tweaks made to improve performance.

  Revised build, test, and plotting apparatus.
