Significant changes in the current development version:

  Fixed a bug in the rounding of a superaccumulator to a double FP
  value (reported by Jan Å tola as issue #1).  The effect of the bug
  was that rounding was incorrect when the correctly-rounded result is
  a negative number with a mantissa consisting of all 1s, and the
  exact value in the superaccumulator is slightly lower (i.e., bigger
  in absolute value). In this case, it rounds to the next floating
  point value below the correct rounding (i.e., the floating-point
  number of the other side of the exact value than the correct rounding).
  This incorrectly caused overflow in the case of -DBL_MAX - 1.

  Fixed a bug in the xsum_small_add_dot function that would sometimes
  lead to a term in the dot product being omitted.  This bug did not
  affect xsum_large_add_dot.

  Added a number of new tests for correctness to xsum-check.

  Added a "fuzzer" for additional testing of the exact summation
  routines, contributed by Kevin Gibbons.

  Added new functions for returning the exactly-rounded result of
  dividing a superaccumulator by a signed or unsigned 32-bit integer.
  This can be used to produce the exactly-rounded mean of a list of
  double values (no more than 2^32-1 of them).  See api-doc for details.

  Revised the manually-optimized code sections, to work better with
  modern processors and compilers.  Also added some (optional) code
  that uses SIMD intrinsics (AVX/SSE) to perhaps speed up some parts.
  These manual optimizations typically produce a small benefit when
  comparing the best results for several compilers, and also reduce
  the variance seen with different compiler versions.

  Some new timing results are now in the newer-results2 directory.

Significant changes in version of 2021-05-17 (tagged as stable-version-2):

  Added xsum_small_add_accumulator and xsum_large_add_accumulator
  procedures, for adding one superaccumulator to another.

  Added xsum_small_negate and xsum_large_negate for negating the
  value in a superaccumulator.

  Added procedures xsum_large_to_small_accumulator and 
  xsum_small_to_large_accumulator, for converting between
  superaccumulator types.

  Added an xsum_large_add1 procedure for completeness.   

  Wrote documentation on the API in api-doc.

  Changed default xsum_length type to ptrdiff_t (from int), so array
  lengths on 64-bit systems will be accomodated, while still (hopefully)
  being 32 bits in size on 32-bit systems.

  Changed build process so pbinary.c is needed only if asked for
  (used only for debug output).

  Various tweaks made to improve performance.

  Revised build, test, and plotting apparatus.
