Significant changes in version of 2021-05-16 (tagged as stable-version-2):

  Added xsum_small_add_accumulator and xsum_large_add_accumulator
  procedures, for adding one superaccumulator to another.

  Added xsum_small_negate and xsum_large_negate for negating the
  value in a superaccumulator.

  Added procedures xsum_large_to_small_accumulator and 
  xsum_small_to_large_accumulator, for converting between
  superaccumulator types.

  Added an xsum_large_add1 procedure for completeness.   

  Wrote documentation on the API in api-doc.

  Changed default xsum_length type to int64_t (from int), so array
  lengths on 64-bit systems will be accomodated.  (Can be changed
  back to int, or int32_t, on 32-bit systems if desired.)

  Changed build process so pbinary.c is needed only if asked for
  (used only for debug output).

  Various tweaks made to improve performance.

  Revised build, test, and plotting apparatus.
